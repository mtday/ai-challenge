# Alion Ai Challenge 2109

This document describes how to duplicate the creation of my submission.

## Setup

Initialize the Jetson Nano device using the following procedures:

* Flash the current Jetson Nano developer kit image onto a 64 GB microSD card.
* Use a jumper to short the J48 pins on the device to support powering from the adapter instead of a USB cable. A USB cable does not provide sufficient power to keep the device powered on.
* Connect the necessary peripherals (keyboard, mouse, monitor, USB wifi)
* Boot the device.
* Follow the boot instructions (accept terms of use, configure locale, create user, connect to wifi, etc.)
* The Ubuntu release that comes with the Jetson Nano developer kit image is slightly out-of-date. Updated it via these commands:
